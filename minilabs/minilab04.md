# Minilab 4

* Go to github.com and create a new repository (public or private),
  when prompted select to add a README.md.
* Clone the repository to your local machine.  If you setup your ssh
  key on github, make sure you copy the ssh url (if you haven't set them
  up yet, now is a good time)
* Create a file with some text and save it in the directory for the repo
* Add the file to the staging area
* Commit the staged item
* Push to the remote
* Go to the remote and edit the file you just pushed by clicking the pencil
  icon.  At the bottom say commit (note -- this isn't something you'd typically do,
  but we will use this is to simulate someone else committing
  to your repo and pushing).
* Go back to your local machine and without pulling, edit the same file.
* Stage and commit the changes
* Try to push -- you should get an error about not pulling
* Pull -- you should have a merge conflict
* Resolve your merge and commit
* Push to the remote
