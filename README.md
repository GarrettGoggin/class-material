### Need Help?
If you have questions, please ask!  I'm here to help -- it'll
just take place in a virtual format.  I welcome students
to just sign-on to the office hour zoom calls and use the time
to work on their projects and listen to questions others might have.

### COVID
Unfortunately, this will not be a typical semester.  This course
will be entirely online, but there will still likely be
surprises and we will need to be flexible to accommodate changes.

I recognize the difficulties some of you may face.
My goal is to make this semester as effective and as smooth
as possible.  Please reach out to me early and keep me informed
of any issues that arise.

### Course Schedule
This table will have all of the lecture video links, due dates, etc.
